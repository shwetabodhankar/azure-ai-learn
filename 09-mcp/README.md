# Using MCP with Agent Framework

We will use a local MCP server that implements a basic calculator functionality implemented in `stdio-server.py` and use it as a tool from Python, `client.py`.

There are some environment variables that you need to set to ensure that the base directory for your code is correct and also the AzureOpenAI Chat Client is able to authenticate using Entra Id.
