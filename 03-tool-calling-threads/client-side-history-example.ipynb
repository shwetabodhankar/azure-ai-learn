    "# Chat Completion Style History Management Example\n",
    "\n",
    "This example demonstrates how conversation history is managed when using **Chat Completion style services** like AzureAIAgentClient with ChatAgent.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Difference (vs Azure AI Agent service):**\n",
    "- The **agent framework** manages conversation history transmission\n",
    "- Full conversation history is sent with each request to the underlying model\n",
    "- The service receives complete context every time (stateless model calls)\n",
    "- Thread storage may still happen on Azure, but the API pattern is different\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important Note:** \n",
    "Even though we use `AzureAIAgentClient`, threads may still be visible in Azure AI Foundry portal. The key difference is in the **API communication pattern**, not necessarily the storage location.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Required Environment Variables:**\n",
    "- `AZURE_AI_PROJECT_ENDPOINT`: Your Azure AI project endpoint\n",
    "- `AZURE_AI_MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME`: The name of your model deployment"

    "- **Agent Service style**: Minimal payload, server manages context\n",
