    "# Server-Side History Storage Example\n",
    "\n",
    "This example demonstrates how conversation history is managed when using the **Azure AI Agent service**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Points:**\n",
    "- Conversation history is stored in the Azure cloud service\n",
    "- Only a thread reference (ID) is sent with each request\n",
    "- The service maintains full conversation state\n",
    "- Network payload remains constant regardless of conversation length\n",
    "\n",
    "**Required Environment Variables:**\n",
    "- `AZURE_AI_PROJECT_ENDPOINT`: Your Azure AI project endpoint\n",
    "\n",
    "**Prerequisites:**\n",
    "- An existing Azure AI Agent created in Azure AI Foundry\n",
    "- Appropriate permissions to access Azure AI Agent service"
